I understand that the police officer who put Eric Garner in a chokehold most likely did not have the \"malicious intent\" to kill him, and that regardless, there was not enough evidence to say that he did. I am not a lawyer and was not present at the trial, so I am aware that I am not qualified to dispute this decision. What I don't understand, however, is why the police officer was not indicted or on trial for unintentional homicide or manslaughter. Is law enforcement protected from any accusations of unintentional killings? What if the victim was unarmed and/or not committing any clear crime (particularly one that wouldn't warrant any force)? Why is this man not being held accountable for killing a man who, if you watch the video, clearly did not need to be killed, whether or not he meant to do so?
